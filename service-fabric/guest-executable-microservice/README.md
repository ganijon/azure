# Guest Executable Microservice

    Service Fabric allows to run any code, such as Node, Java, C++ or .Net as a microservice. 

    These type of services are treated like stateless services and referred to as guest executables.  
    
    They are packaged and deployed on nodes of the Service Fabric cluster based on their settings.
    
    There are certain benefits running the code as guest executables:
    
        - High avaiability
        - Health monitoring
        - Application lifecycle management
        - High Density
        - Discovery
